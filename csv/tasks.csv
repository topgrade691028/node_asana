Jeff -

I think the two use cases we're looking at are:
- Viewing your results by goal, and comparing variations
- Viewing your results by variations, and then analyzing a few different goals (e.g., sign up bronze, sign up silver, sign up gold)

The new results page is best for use case 1 and not as good for use case 2.
A few things:

In the multivariate branch, I've significantly decreased the padding on the results rows, which will help get more information in a screen. I also implemented a stylistic change on row hovering, so you can hover your mouse over a row to help keep it top-of-mind. These help.
We don't really want to support two different results pages.

<quote>
I'd like to be clear on the reason for the request so that it can receive the consideration it deserves. Otherwise, I suspect it would be turned down.
I suspect that the original intent for the the additional Targeting options was for narrowing down Visitors or Visitor Types. That would make these targeting options appear apply only to the Experiment as a whole. Clearly, an Experiment would be useless if a visitor could were to navigate in and out of a test.

With that in mind, I'm really only requesting a subset of the remaining Targeting options. Certainly, there's no point in offering:

* Use the browsers
* Prefer these languages
* Come from these locations

This leaves the following (ordered by priority – high to low):

1. Satisfy this custom Javascript condition
2. Have any of these cookies
3. Come from these URLs
4. Trigger any of these custom events /Are in an of these segments*

Here are a few reasons why these targeting criteria would be invaluable tools for determine whether or not to Activate a Variation on a given page:

1. [Primary] The ability to use javaScript conditions, Custom Events, or even Cookies to determine the page a user is viewing.
2. Activate a Variation one page on a given page based on:
* Cookie dropped by the same Variation on a different page
* Coming from a specific page on the site (alternate funnel)

* - We currently have code in the Global JS that generates a Custom Event that identifies the page on (document).ready. We use if for our Goals/Segments to measure or filter by visits that view specific pages. I'm not sure about the timing on this. I'm imagining that custom events fired in (document).ready are too late to register in the evaluation portion of Activation.

Firefox 20 implements the WebIDL specification for HTML elements. This means that properties on HTML elements are implemented via getter/setter pairs (which was already the case) but also that the ones shared by all HTML elements are a getter/setter pair on HTMLElement.prototype (whereas before they were getter/setter pairs on the most-derived prototype).

Now cnn.com loads <script src=""http://cdn.optimizely.com/js/131788053.js""></script> which goes 
through and removes all enumerable properties from HTMLElement.prototype, then restores their values and getters but not their setters.

Which means that once this script has run, setting innerHTML on, say, an HTML <div> no longer works. Neither does setting all sorts of other 
properties (e.g. no more setting onclick, etc).

Would you mind fixing your script to preserve setters as well, not just 
getters?

Account ID: 87796598
Email: dae-ho@optimizely.com
Experiment ID: 130971559 (variations #3 and #4 that start with ""Rearranging..."")

To Reproduce (in the Editor):
1. If no element contains a period in its ID or class, add an ID or class to an element on the page that contains a period. Ex variation code:
$(""h3"").attr('id','test.12345');
$(""h3"").addClass('test.12345');

2. Grab an unrelated element, select ""Rearrange"", and attempt to move this new element before the element with the ""."" in the ID/class from step 1.

3. Open the ""Edit Code"" box and add check the .insertBefore( ) argument and see that the period is escaped with only one ""\"". You should also be able to observe if you click back and forth between variations that the detached element no longer exists in the Editor preview.

Current Result: Rearranged element is detached permanently from the page/removed.

Correct Result: Rearranged element should be re-inserted.

Severity estimate: Not very. But perhaps its indicative of other problems with how Rearrange escapes certain characters?

For example, if I run a test that affects the Home and Business free trial pages, I want to see if there is a difference in results for people who hit the test on the Home free trial page vs people who hit the test on the Business free trial page.

*from an email from the mailchimp team:

Thanks for the call today.

Google Anlaytics tagging (this is turned on by the MailChimp user when creating a campaign)

Below is a real string for a campaign. The source tag is the list name. The first value in the campaign tag is our campaign ID, the remainder is the campaign subject line. If you know the MailChimp user then with the campaign ID you an associate this with a single campaign. We offer both API key account access as well as OAuth2.

http://blog.mailchimp.com/instagram-integration/?utm_source=MailChimp+Blog+Updates&utm_campaign=5ae61acf71-MAILCHIMP_BLOG_RSS_CMPN&utm_medium=email

To add an email address to a MailChimp list you can use the API call below:
http://apidocs.mailchimp.com/api/how-to/basic-subscribe.php

You can also use our embedded signup form approach to adding an address to a list. The advantage is that you don't need to send us an API call to make the addition.
http://kb.mailchimp.com/article/how-can-i-add-my-signup-form-on-my-website

If and when you're interested in capturing the identity of a visitor, you can use our eCommerce360 tracking tags. While it was created originally for eCommerce360, it can be used for any vertical that is interested in tracking individual activities. When this is turned on for a campaign we automatically append two parameters one is the campaign ID tag and the second is the email ID. 
http://apidocs.mailchimp.com/api/how-to/ecommerce.php

I will discuss with our guys about how we might be able to leverage your event tracking capability to potentially trigger drip campaigns in MailChimp.

From: alix.george@holidayextras.com
Hi there,

Just a general inquiry, but does Optimizely have any plans on the road map regarding collecting customer feedback? 

Currently we use Optimizely to set-up, edit and run our split-tests, but although we've got a wealth of quantifiable data, the value of coupling this with qualitative data would be huge.

There are many companies who offer this service, but it'd benefit your customers if there was a capability to, not only test different variations across the Optimizely platform, but link up the data collected with contextual information about the UX, any friction, etc.

Alix

Suppose February 22nd 10.00 am was confirmed to be scheduled.

Log servers
Incoming events/sec, broken down by account or experiment
Http request completion latency and status code breakdown

Insert servers
incoming counting events/sec (broken down by insert server and count server); should reconcile with log server event/sec

Count servers
Count jobs/sec (broken down by count server and process, and by job types of filter.update and filter._process_filter
Context: filter.update is called every time an event comes in, or an invalidation is invoked; after checking to see if filter should be updated, it queues up the filter._process_filter job
Impact: can determine where the bottlenecks, and whether they are leading to results latencies
Number of events processed per job (a job is called an interation)
How many events are duplicates (for first event events)
Filter update metrics (broken down by description of filter)
Report rolling data calculation inconsistencies between filters and time series
Number of duplicate time series

Api servers
Http request completion latency and status code breakdown
Third party operations:

MongoDB
Latency on all db operations (broken by dbs, and function calls)
Error frequencies (due to timeouts)
On config servers, looking at how many balance ops/sec, how many chunk migrations/sec, how many splits/sec
Average age of last balance operation (indicates when to add shard)

Memcache
Success and latency of all memcache operations

GAE operations (since it has cascading effects)
Will indicate if/what we should change in our dependency on GAE

Redis
All ops/sec
Memory as reported by Redis
Number of connected clients, number of key stores, number of blocked clients, changes since last save, how long ago did last save occur",null
